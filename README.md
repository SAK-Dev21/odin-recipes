# Introduction
This project is a simple website, comprised of HTML only, where it shows you different recipes and how to make them.
The skills that I would demonstrate upon completion are:
- Understanding of different HTML elements like <ol>, <ul>, <a>, <img>, <h1>, <strong>, <br>, <em> and more!
- Developing git commit skills and practising how to write good commit messages!
- Improving how I write my instructions for recipes!

#Reflection
- I practised writing good commit messages, especially for the events of sharing code or working with other people.
- My recipe instructions in my personal Notion workspace look MUCH BETTER!
- I have gotten the hang of HTML elements/tags like the ones mentioned under Introduction.

I enjoyed making this project as I got to develop these skills and benefit personally from it, in ways I wouldn't expect!
