    <!-- Steps -->
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <h3>Part 1</h3>

        <li>Heat up pan.</li>
        <li>Add oil and wait until oil bubbles (test by putting a big spoon on the pan's surface).</li>
        <li>Add onions, garlic and ginger. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add ingredients in Seasoning. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add hot water to the mixture until the ingredients are barely submerged by the water (think of being in a bath, there is water coming up to you but you aren't drowning).
            Cook on low heat for 10 minutes.
        </li>

        <h3>Part 2</h3>
        
        <li>After 10 minutes have passed, add minced meat to the pan and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add Potatoes.</li>
        <li> Add water <strong>if needed.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li> The mixture should look like it is barely sticking out of the water (remember the bath analogy).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Cook on low heat for 40-50 minutes and put a lid on the pan.
            <ul>
                <li> During this time, every 20 minutes or so, check on the mixture from time to time and stir gently. Taste with a teaspoon to see if you should add more salt.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Once ready, turn off the heat and let the pan cool for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>DONE!</li>

     </ol>
